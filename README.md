### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am IvÃ¡n MuÃ±oz Gomez, a passionate Full Stack Developer with a strong Front End background.

In the past, I pursued a career in Front End Development, as I am fascinated by creating interactive experiences that captivate users. However, my ambition to cover all aspects of web development led me to broaden my knowledge and skills towards Full Stack Development.

In this field, staying up-to-date with emerging technologies to streamline tasks is essential, which is why I am enthusiastic about learning them to become a more well-rounded developer.

Some technologies I normally use are: HTML - CSS - JavaScript - Bootstrap - React - Redux - Node.Js - Express - PostgreSQL - Sequelize -
